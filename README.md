# 100_days_of_ML_Code
Inspired by AI mentor Siraj's hashtag #100DaysOfMLCode. Day started from February 15, 2019. I am just a beginner so i am doing just learning prerequisties.
I am following prerequisites for ML code, which are libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, OpenCv, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow etc.
